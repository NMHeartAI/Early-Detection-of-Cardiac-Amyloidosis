# Using Artificial Intelligence for the Early Detection of Cardiac Amyloidosis
*AHA Award Number: 856917*

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a highly morbid cause of heart failure (HF), itself a common and costly condition affecting over 6.2 million US adults.
Until recently, CA was thought to be a rare disease. However, emerging data indicate that CA is far more common, comprising 13 to 17% of HF with preserved ejection fraction cases.
Mortality rates are high: after HF onset, the median survival is six months for AL and five years for TTR cardiac amyloidosis if untreated. 
Prior studies have revealed the presence of early clinical clues of CA, including symptoms, lab abnormalities, and changes on  echocardiograms (echo) and electrocardiograms (ECG).
Identifying early signs is essential given the emergence of novel therapies which can halt CA disease progression and dramatically improve prognosis.
However, despite the clear benefit of early identification and intervention for CA, CA remains severely underdiagnosed, particularly at early stages and among Black adults.
Addressing this scientific and implementation gap to improve early diagnosis and linkage to therapy for CA patients is therefore imperative and offers the potential for rapid, dramatic reduction in
preventable CA-related morbidity and mortality.
Widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have created the opportunity to detect CA early and understand its underlying pathogenesis.
Prior studies have used AI on ECG and echo data to identify patients with prevalent cardiac amyloidosis.11-13 These models were trained on data at the time of diagnosis and not on data preceding diagnosis, limiting the potential applicability for identifying early CA features preceding CA diagnosis. 
Indeed, no studies have examined in detail changes in cardiac mechanics and structure on echo in patients with cardiac amyloidosis years preceding diagnosis. 
Additionally, our team has validated a diagnosis code-based machine learning model to predict the risk of CA (under review). 
However, there remain significant gaps and further work is needed to improve and implement the tool.
This study aims to comprehensively (1) describe the early clinical manifestations of CA preceding overt diagnosis / disease progression and (2) use these findings to develop high-performing AI algorithms and clinical decision support tools for the early detection of CA. 
We will do this by leveraging a novel, integrated deep phenotyping database with longitudinal echo data created by Dr. Ahmad and an interdisciplinary team as part of the Institute for Augmented
Intelligence in Medicine. 
The specific aims are to:
- Aim 1: Define cardiac mechanical abnormalities preceding diagnosis and disease progression of CA using traditional echo measures and with AI.
    - H1a: Subtle changes in cardiac structure and mechanics will be seen on echo at least 2 years before the diagnosis of CA.
    - H1b: AI can identify early manifestations of CA in patients with subclinical evidence of CA on echo.

- Aim 2: Test an AI-application that integrates diagnosis codes and text using deep learning-based natural language processing to identify CA patients.
    - H2: An integrated pipeline will have better performance than models using ICD codes alone.

- Aim 3: Evaluate the usability, feasibility, acceptability of an AI-powered clinical decision tool that flags patients with a high probability of having or developing CA.
    - H3: Gathering feedback on the design of AI-powered clinical decision tools will help improve clinical acceptance.
